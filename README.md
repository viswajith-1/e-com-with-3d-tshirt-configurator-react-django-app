Nexus | 3D Interactive E-Commerce Platform
Nexus is a full-featured web application that bridges the gap between traditional e-commerce and interactive design. It integrates a standard branded apparel store with a powerful real-time 3D configurator, allowing users to design, visualize, and purchase custom apparel within a single unified platform.

Built with a React frontend and Django backend, this project solves the "visualization gap" in print-on-demand services by leveraging WebGL technology to drive user engagement and reduce return rates.
